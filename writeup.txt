Write up for Kaitlin Sloan and Voona Praneetha. 
For what went well, our implimication for the board and adding the sankes and ladders was done quickly and efficently. 
If we had a bigger board for the game then there would be more snakes and ladders and it isnt an optimal way to implement it using the switch statements and having each
turn be in main instead of in its own function. Also a lot of main is very repetitive with both  player 1 and player 2's turns being almost identical. Our initial plan to 
implement the game didnt go as plan as we ended up not needing two of the functions we were initially going to use. 
Through this project we learned how to make sometimes your intial ideas don't work completely and we learnded how to modify it. 
We should get full discrentionary points because we made it user interactive and made a clear board representation.
