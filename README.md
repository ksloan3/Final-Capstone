# Final-Capstone
COSC202 Capstone Project for Dr. Emrich


This Program is a simple Snake and Ladders game. The board is a 5x5 board with three snakes and three ladders. 
To interact with the game, you press enter to "roll the dice." the program outputs your roll and then outputs the player's new position. It automatically changes players, so when Player One's turn is done, it will output that it's Player 2's turn and press enter again to roll the dice.
